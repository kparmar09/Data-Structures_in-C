The basic Knowledge of how to Implement Data Structures from the ground up and also how various functions are working in accordance with these Data Structures.
## The Data Structures in this Repository are:-
### 1. Arrays ADT - Not in this repo but used in implementation of different Data Structures
### 2. Linked List - Both Singly and Doubly with Circular Lists
### 3. Stack - Using both Array and Linked Representation
### 4. Queues - Simple, Circular and Double Ended Queue. (With both Array and Linked Representation)
